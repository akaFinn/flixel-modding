### Added

- Fully functional support with OpenFL's/Lime's Asset system
- Compatibility with HaxeFlixel version's under 5.9.0 (Wow so awesome and cool)
- Some more sizes for the logo so that it wouldn't look so compressed
- Created new classes: 
  - `flixel.system.FlxModpack` and `flixel.system.FlxModpack.FlxMetadataFormat` classes that are represented for flixel modpacks
  - `flixel.system.polymod.PolymodModpack` and `flixel.system.polymod.PolymodModpack.PolymodMetadataFormat` classes that are represented for polymod modpacks
  - `flixel.system.FlxBaseModpack` and `flixel.system.FlxBaseModpack.FlxBaseMetadataFormat` classes that are designed to be extended
- Added `exists` to `FlxModding` a function that checks if a modpack actually exists via a file name
- Created new File System classes:
  - `flixel.system.fileSystem.IFileSystem` an interface used as a base for all file system classes
  - `flixel.system.fileSystem.SysFileSystem` a class used as an alternative the sys package file system
  - `flixel.system.fileSystem.RamFileSystem` a class that takes cache data and uses it as its own system
  - `flixel.system.fileSystem.WebFileSystem` a class designed for JS/Web build targets

### Changed
- Changed a few things in the `README.md` file to make it *cleaner* if that makes sense
- Changed how ALL modpack's load/reload, each different modpack type is no longer defined via a variable and instead each one has their own class such as `FlxModpack` or `PolymodModpack`
- Reworked how the `reload` function works so that it takes all modpack types
- Reworked the `get` function from `FlxModding` works so now its based off of the file name for the modpack and not the display name and it also checks if the modpack exists
- Fully Reworked the `create` function for `FlxModding` to know allow you to create different types of modpacks `FLIXEL`, `POLYMOD`, & `CUSTOM`
- Changed the `sort` function for `FlxModding` to be based of the `ID` parameter instead of a custom one
- Renamed the `redirect` function from `FlxModding` to `sanitize`
- Renamed the `pathway` function from `FlxModding` to `redirect`

### Removed
- All instances of OpenFL's/Lime's Asset system seen in flixel modding, and replaced their respective caching systems with `FlxCache`
- The `allowCaching` parameter for the `init` function in `flixel.system.FlxModding`
- Removed `FlxCache` due to it being pointless and fucking dumb

# [1.3.0] - (July 26, 2025)

- Added `type` in `flixel.system.FlxModpack` to tell the difference between Flixel Modpacks and Polymod mod's
- Added `metaDirectory` in `flixel.system.FlxModpack` a function that acts like the `directory` function except it returns the pathway to the metadata depending on the type of modpack
- Added `iconDirectory` in `flixel.system.FlxModpack` a function that acts like the `directory` function except it returns the pathway to the icon depending on the type of modpack

- Added `caching` to `flixel.system.FlxModding`, a toggle for people who donâ€™t want their assets cached when loaded (default: `false`)
- Added `update` to `flixel.system.FlxModding`, a function to update the metadata of multiple modpacks or a single one

- Changed `toString` from `flixel.system.FlxModpack` to properly output `FlxModpack` data
